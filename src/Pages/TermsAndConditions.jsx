        YDot Games is a portal of multiple skill-based, multiple level and
        highly engaging and casual web (HTML5) games in which subscribed users
        can play the games for unlimited times. Users can play any game of their
        choice in the portal and the scores from any game are aggregated onto a
        common leaderboard which will be the basis for awarding prizes. The
        service is available exclusively to MTN subscribers who constitute
        natural persons and have been vetted as such by way of the RICA process
        (“the Users”). The Service is based on a daily subscription fee of 5.00
        ZAR (incl. VAT), where subscribers earn points which accumulate daily on
        a leaderboard. The first ten (ten) users who are atop the
        leaderboard win guaranteed daily prizes in the form of popular store
        vouchers and/or MTN airtime. The first ten (10) users who accumulate the
        highest scores in a month will be eligible to get cash prizes.{" "}
